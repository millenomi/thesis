 Handles a message coming from the sensor sink. The return value will be used to determine if the message should be further processed by the sink or not. (Regardless of what you return, all taps will receive the message.)
 
 @param s The sensor sink this message was sent to.
 @param messageContent A JSON-like fragment, consisting of either a NSString, NSNumber, NSNull object, NSArray or NSDictionary. NSArrays will only contain objects of the aforementioned classes, whereas NSDictionaries will only contain objects of the aforementioned classes as values and NSStrings as keys.
 @param channels A set of strings, the channels this message was sent to. (For more information, see ILSensorSink#logMessageWithContent:forChannels:.)
 
 @return YES if you want to allow the sensor sink to further handle the message; NO if you have fully handled it. (In this version of Telemetry, the sensor sink's handling of a message prints a summary of that message to the console via NSLog.) If multiple taps are attached to a sink, any of them returning NO will prevent the message from being processed by the sink. Note that regardless of return value, all taps attached to a sink will receive the message; only further processing by the sink is prevented.
